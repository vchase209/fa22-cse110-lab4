4.[50,100,150], var can be referenced and changed within the function its declared, thus each change to variables due to an iteration of the for loop is retained\
5.Error, let is declared within the for loop, thus it can't be accessed outside of for loop\
6.Error, discountedPrice out of scope, it is declared within the for loop, so it can't be accessed outside of for loop\

A.true, '2' converted to integer\
B.false, '12' is greater than '2' in lexicographical order\
C.true, '2' converted to integer\
D.false, they are not the same type\
E.false, true converted to 1\
F.true, any Boolean explicit type conversion of number > 0 is true, both sides are of type boolean so equality comparison happens normally\
15.=== returns false if operands are not of the same type, otherwise they are the same\
